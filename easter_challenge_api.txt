Easter Bunny Hunting: 

setup
A square grid 99 x 99
4 egg hunters, one at each corner.
Easter bunny in the middle (it has 100 eggs)


Hunters:
They are run by an array of functions
[
  # NW
  function(api, my_storage, shared_storage) {
    
  },
  # NE
  function(api, my_storage, shared_storage) {
    
  },
  # SE
  function(api, my_storage, shared_storage) {
    
  },
  # SW
  function(api, my_storage, shared_storage) {
    
  }
]

api.north()
api.east()
api.south()
api.west()
# Most recently called moves
# If not called, no move

api.turn()

api.hunters = [
  {
    x: int,
    y: int,
    me: boolean
  },
  ...
]
api.bunny = {
  x: int,
  y: int,
  eggs_left: 100
}
api.eggs = [
  {
    x: int, y: int
  },
  ...
]
my_storage = {}
shared_storage = {}

Turn structure:
* run the 4 functions in turn, if NESW called take one step
* If stepped on to egg, gain point.
* If caught the bunny, gain 10 points.

Bunny movement rules:
* x_target is x + (hunters_above - hunters_below)
* y_target is y + (hunters_left - hunters_right)
* if x_target/y_target is not current location...
* * leave egg on current position (if current position doesn't already have an egg)
* * reduce eggs remaining
* * Bunny hop to target
* If out of bounds, end game
* If 0 eggs left, end game
